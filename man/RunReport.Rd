\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat or similar single-cell object containing preprocessed single-cell data.
It is expected that basic preprocessing steps (e.g., using \code{RunPreprocess} or equivalent)
have already been applied.}

\item{VDJ_data}{An optional list containing processed VDJ (T-cell receptor or B-cell receptor) data.
If provided, relevant VDJ-specific QC metrics will be integrated into the report.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{sample.by}{The name of the column in metadata that uniquely identifies different samples.
This is crucial for grouping and analyzing data across different samples.
Defaults to \code{"orig.ident"}.}

\item{outputFile}{The full path, including filename, where the generated HTML report will be saved.
The directory will be created if it does not exist.
Defaults to \code{"./SingleCellMQC/SingleCellMQC.html"}.}

\item{do.sample}{A logical value indicating whether the sample-level QC module should be included
in the report. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{do.cell}{A logical value indicating whether the cell-level QC module should be included
in the report. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{do.feature}{A logical value indicating whether the feature-level (gene/ADT) QC module
should be included in the report. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{do.batch}{A logical value indicating whether the batch effect assessment module should be
included in the report. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{RNA_cluster_name}{The name of the column in metadata that stores RNA-based cluster assignments.
Used for visualizing RNA clustering and batch effects.
Defaults to \code{"rna_cluster"}.}

\item{ADT_cluster_name}{The name of the column in metadata that stores ADT-based cluster assignments.
Used for visualizing ADT clustering and batch effects in multi-modal data.
Defaults to \code{"adt_cluster"}.}

\item{RNA.batch.by}{A character vector specifying one or more column names in metadata
that represent categorical variables used for RNA batch identification or for
grouping cells in PCA/UMAP plots related to RNA data.
Defaults to \code{"orig.ident"}.}

\item{ADT.batch.by}{A character vector specifying one or more column names in metadata
that represent categorical variables used for ADT batch identification or for
grouping cells in PCA/UMAP plots related to ADT data.
Defaults to \code{"orig.ident"}.}

\item{RNA.covariate.formula}{An optional formula (e.g., \code{~ (1|batch1) + (1|batch2)}) specifying covariates for
RNA data used in batch effects analysis.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{ADT.covariate.formula}{An optional formula (e.g., \code{~ (1|batch1) + (1|batch2)}) specifying covariates for
ADT data used in batch effects analysis.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{RNA.covariate.other}{A character vector of additional covariates (column names from \code{meta.data})
relevant for RNA data analysis, but not necessarily part of a formula.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{ADT.covariate.other}{A character vector of additional covariates (column names from \code{meta.data})
relevant for ADT data analysis.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{celltype.by}{The name of the column in metadata that contains cell type annotations.
This is used for cell type-specific QC metrics and visualizations.
Defaults to \code{"ScType"}.}

\item{do.covariate.split.celltype}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, covariate analysis plots (if applicable)
will be split or faceted by cell type.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{tissue}{An optional character string specifying the tissue source of the samples.
This information can be incorporated into sample-level QC plots for context.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{marker_genes}{A character vector of well-known marker genes to be specifically highlighted
in the feature QC section, such as those used for cell type identification.
Defaults to a predefined list of immune cell markers.}

\value{
This function does not explicitly return a value. Instead, it generates and saves
a comprehensive HTML report to the path specified by \code{outputFile}.
}
\description{
This function orchestrates the generation of an interactive HTML report for single-cell data quality control (QC).
It consolidates various QC modules, including sample-level, cell-level, feature-level, and batch effect assessments,
into a unified and easily digestible document. Users can customize which QC modules are included and specify
parameters relevant to their data and analysis goals.

\title{Plot Variance Partition Results as Stacked Bar}
\usage{
PlotVarPartStackBar(
  object,
  sort.by = NULL,
  ntop = 10,
  split.by = "Group",
  color = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A data frame, typically the output of \code{RunVarPartMetadata},
\code{RunVarPartPseudobulk}, or \code{RunVarPartPseudobulkPCA}. It should contain
at least 'Feature' and 'Group' columns (if applicable), and columns
representing the variance components (e.g., 'donor_id', 'batch').}

\item{sort.by}{(Optional) A character vector of column names (variance components)
by which to sort the features. Features will be sorted descending by the
sum of variance explained by these components. If \code{NULL}, features are
plotted in their original order.}

\item{ntop}{An integer specifying the number of top features to display.
Defaults to 10.}

\item{split.by}{A character string specifying a column in \code{object} to split
the plotting by. Typically 'Group' when results from multiple groups are combined.
Defaults to "Group".}

\item{color}{(Optional) A character vector of colors to be used for filling
the stacked bars. If \code{NULL}, default colors are assigned.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object (or a list of \code{ggplot} objects if \code{split.by} leads to
multiple facets/plots) representing the stacked bar charts of variance explained.
}
\description{
Generates stacked bar charts to visualize the proportion of variance explained
for the top features, ordered by specified covariates.

\usage{
SummarySample(
  object,
  sample.by = "orig.ident",
  tissue = NULL,
  celltype.by = NULL,
  db_filter_columns = NULL,
  lq_filter_columns = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A single-cell object containing single-cell data.}

\item{sample.by}{A character string indicating the metadata column in \code{object}
that identifies individual samples (default: "orig.ident").}

\item{tissue}{An optional character string specifying the tissue type, used for
\code{FindCommonPCTOutlier} (e.g., "blood").}

\item{celltype.by}{An optional character string indicating the metadata column
that stores cell type annotations. Required for cell type-based outlier detection and proportion analysis.}

\item{db_filter_columns}{A character vector of column names (e.g., doublet prediction methods)
in the object's cell-level metadata. These columns are expected to
contain "Pass" or "Fail" values. Cells will be considered "database filtered" if they
have a "Fail" value in \emph{at least one} of the specified \code{db_filter_columns}.}

\item{lq_filter_columns}{A character vector of column names (e.g., low quality flags)
in the object's cell-level metadata. These columns are expected to
contain "Pass" or "Fail" values. Cells will be considered "low quality filtered" if they
have a "Fail" value in \emph{at least one} of the specified \code{lq_filter_columns}.}
}
\value{
A data frame, where each row represents a sample (defined by \code{sample.by}),
and columns contain various summary metrics and QC flags.
}
\description{
This function generates a comprehensive summary QC table for each sample,
including base QC metrics, predicted sex,
10X Genomics Cell Ranger alerts, cell filtering results, metrics outlier detection,
and celltype proportion analysis.
